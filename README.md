#### Training a model using Meta's Wav2Vec2 to recognize mispronunciations in Cantonese

My Cantonese is worse than it should be for someone who grew up in Hong Kong. I'm okay at conversing,
but have always wondered if there was a way to use coding to improve my pronunciation. It turns out there
<em>is</em> a way â€” I've trained a model to recognize phoneme-level mispronunciations in Cantonese. Although
it's obviously imperfect (there are many other factors that affect pronunciation), it's a start. I
use this as a tool to improve my own pronunciation, and hope others to do the same.
